# Prototypical Plus

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/adamphillips/prototypical_plus.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/adamphillips/prototypical_plus)

Prototypical Plus builds on
[Prototypical](https://github.com/adamphillips/prototypical) by adding some
predefined components to use when prototyping.

Or at least it will anyway. So far it doesn't do much of anything...
